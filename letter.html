        To the person who has brought a sprark of joy into my life, thank you
        for the amazing time you have made me have. Ever since we started
        dating, my life has been filled with happy moments. Whether its 1v1-ing
        on OverWatch, and me completely demolishing you, or me carrying you on
        Apex. Not only virtually, but you have also brought me joy with real
        life events. Our dates specially. Being with you and walking around
        exploring is something I will always treasure.I don't know what the
        future holds for us, however I just want you to know that you hold a
        special place in my heart. PS. Notice how there are commas in there.
